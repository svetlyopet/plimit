# plimit â€” cgroup v2 limiter for a running process

`plimit` is a CLI tool that creates (or reuses) cgroups
and moves a target PID into it, applying CPU, memory, and block I/O limits.

> Requires Linux with the unified cgroup v2 hierarchy mounted at `/sys/fs/cgroup`,
and to be executed with root priviledges.

## Features
- Create a dedicated cgroup for an existing process
- Apply CPU quota/percent, memory max, and io.max rules
- Auto-enable controllers in the parent cgroup (cpu, memory, io)
- Move the PID into the new cgroup
- Optional attach-only mode and clean deletion
- Dry-runs and verbose logging

## Quick start
```bash
make
sudo plimit --pid 1234 --cpu-percent 50 --mem-max 2G --io-max "8:0 rbps=1048576 wbps=1048576"
```
